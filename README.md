## Function of a Resume Builder

A resume builder is a tool that helps users create professional resumes quickly and easily. It typically provides templates and guides users through the process of entering their personal information, work experience, education, skills, and other relevant details. The resume builder then formats this information into a well-structured resume that can be downloaded, printed, or shared online.
